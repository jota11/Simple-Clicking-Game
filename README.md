# Simple-Clicking-Game
## A very simple clicking game made in LUA using the LÖVE2D engine.

A simple, very rudimentary game I made a few weeks ago to learn LUA, using the **[LÖVE2D](https://github.com/love2d/love)** framework. I've given up very quickly/early on since I've decided to move on to **[Solar2D](https://github.com/coronalabs/corona)** aka Corona SDK.

Instead of deleting it like I do with many other personal projects, I decided to post it here in case I wanna revisit it someday.

To compile/test it, of course, you will need to download **[LÖVE2D](https://github.com/love2d/love)**. If you need help on it, go read their **[documentation](https://love2d.org/wiki/love)**

You can download the compiled version of the game by clicking **[here](https://github.com/jota11/Simple-Clicking-Game/releases/latest)**, or simply going to the **[Releases](https://github.com/jota11/Simple-Clicking-Game/releases)** page of this repository.
